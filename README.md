# studioTest

To get started clone the application into the folder of your choosing.

run `git clone git@github.com:gsmith77/studioTest.git`

# Get It Off The Ground

get into the root of the project 'studioTest'
run:   `yarn install`
 
 
Open a terminal
run:   `cd backend/ && rails s`


Open ANOTHER terminal
get into the root of the project 'studioTest`
run:   `yarn start`

I tried to do the testing for 20 minutes but I will be honest I have not done testing before so I did not want to take a long time focusing
on that whenever I had everything else done. Beginning now, I will focus more on testing to make sure I am more prepared for the position.
